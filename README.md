# :robot: Ohm's Law Workshop

## ü§ì Overview and learning outcomes 
Ohm's law states that the current through a conductor between two points is directly proportional to the voltage across the two points. Introducing the constant of proportionality, the resistance, one arrives at the three mathematical equations used to describe this relationship (where V = voltage, I = current and R = resistance):

$$V = IR$$

$$I = ( {\frac{V}{{R}}} )$$

$$R = ( {\frac{V}{{I}}} )$$

Ohm's law states that the R in this relation is constant, independent of the current. If the resistance is not constant, the previous equation cannot be called Ohm's law, but it can still be used as a definition of static/DC resistance.  We will look at both constant and dynamic resistance examples.

The goal of this lab assignment is to learn how to utilize Ohm's law to calculate Voltage, Current and Resistance, as well as power.  You will build circuits of your choosing to demonstrate your understanding of these concepts.  Both linear and non-linear conduction will be addressed here as well. You will also learn some valuable Markdown skills in your submission.üöÄ

## Required Reading

In order to have the necessary background information for this project you should have thoroughly read [Chapter 2 - Ohm's Law](https://www.allaboutcircuits.com/textbook/direct-current/#chpt-2) of our online text.  Be sure to focus on the terms below.

## üíª Terms to know

- Voltage
- Current
- Resistance
- Ohm's Law
- Power
- Linear Conductivity
- Nonlinear Conductivity
- Voltage Drops
- Polarity

## üìù Next steps

You will demonstrate that you have learned how to use Ohm's law next class by creating a unique example of this application.  To prepare for that, do the following:

1. Create a file named "Observations.md" here to record everything.
2. Create a simple circuit with only a resistor (R<sub>1</sub>) which is smaller than 50 Ohms, an LED, power and ground.  Use our variable power supplies to electrify the circuit.  Measure Total Voltage (V<sub>T</sub>), Current (I) and resistance of R<sub>1</sub> with a multimeter.  Determine the resistance of that moment of the LED using Ohm's Law. Calculate power of the circuit.  Shoot a photo of your circuit and include it in the file.  Read over this simple [cheat sheet](https://gist.github.com/LKS90/252ac41bd4a173be35b0) for using Latex in a markdown file.  Use what you learn to put your equations in the file.
3. Now, increase the voltage by one volt and rerecord everything from the previous step.  This should begin to form a linear relationship between voltage and current.
4. Record all of your observations for at least 15 variations of V<sub>T</sub>. In a table in your markdown file like the one below:

| V<sub>T</sub> | I<sub>T</sub> | R<sub>1</sub> | R<sub>LED</sub>| Power |
|---------|---------------|----|------|-------|
|         |               |    |      |       |
|         |               |    |      |       |
|         |               |    |      |       |
|         |               |    |      |       |
|         |               |    |      |       |
|         |               |    |      |       |
|         |               |    |      |       |
|         |               |    |      |       |
|         |               |    |      |       |
|         |               |    |      |       |
|         |               |    |      |       |
|         |               |    |      |       |
|         |               |    |      |       |
|         |               |    |      |       |
|         |               |    |      |       |


5. Copy the data into a google spreadsheet, insert a line chart, copy that chart image into your file.
6. Write about what you have learned in this activity using at lease six of the "Terms to know" above.  In markdown, make all of those terms **bold** so they stand out.
7. Be prepared to explain your observations next time.
